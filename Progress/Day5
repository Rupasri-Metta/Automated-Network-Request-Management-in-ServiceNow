# Day 5 – Flow Creation & Implementation

## 1. Flow Creation
- Designed **end-to-end flows** for Service Catalog request handling.  
- Configured a **record-based trigger** (when a request item is created).  

## 2. Trigger Configuration
- Mapped triggers to **custom request tables**.  
- Applied conditions (e.g., trigger only if *Request Category = "IT Services"*).  

## 3. Action Configuration
- Configured actions such as:  
  - Generating **approval tasks**  
  - Updating **request status**  
  - Sending **notification emails** to users and approvers  
- Linked **approval records** to request records.  

## 4. Flow Chart Documentation
- Created **flowchart representation** for documentation and presentation.  
- Showed process from:  
  *Request Submission → Approval → Fulfillment → Closure*  

## 5. Testing Flow
- Submitted requests in **Service Catalog** to validate flow execution.  
- Verified approvals, notifications, and status updates.
