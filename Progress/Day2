# Day 2 – Creation of Tables

## 1. Table Creation
- Created **custom tables** in the application scope to store request data.  
- Named and structured tables to align with **Service Catalog items**.  

## 2. Field Creation
- Added fields of different types:  
  - String  
  - Choice  
  - Reference  
  - Date/Time  
  - Integer  
- Assigned attributes:  
  - Maximum length  
  - Mandatory  
  - Default values  

## 3. Defining Field Properties
- Defined **business rules** for uniqueness and validations.  
- Implemented **reference fields** for linking with existing tables (e.g., *User table*, *Incident table*).  

## 4. Adding Fields to Form
- Customized **table form layout** for better user experience.  
- Reordered fields logically:  
  - User details → Request details → Status  
- Tested forms by creating **sample records**.
