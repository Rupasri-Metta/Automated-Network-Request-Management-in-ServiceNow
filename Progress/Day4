# Day 4 â€“ Flow Designer (Overview of Flows & Actions)

## 1. Navigating to Flow Designer
- Accessed **Flow Designer** from the application navigator.  
- Explored the Flow Designer workspace:  
  - Flows  
  - Actions  
  - Subflows  
  - Data pills  

## 2. Flow Designer Components
- Understood **Triggers**:  
  - Record-based  
  - Schedule-based  
  - Application-based  
- Learned about **Actions**:  
  - Create Record  
  - Update Record  
  - Send Email  
  - Approval  
- Explored **Data Pills** for referencing data dynamically.  

## 3. Creating a Flow
- Created a simple test flow with a **trigger** (e.g., when a record is created in a table).  

## 4. Adding Actions
- Configured multiple actions:  
  - Record Creation  
  - Notification  
- Mapped inputs using **data pills** from the trigger record.  

## 5. Testing & Debugging
- Tested flow execution by submitting new records.  
- Debugged issues using **execution logs**.  

## 6. Best Practices Learned
- Adopted **modular design** using subflows.  
- Avoided hard-coded values by using **data pills**.  
- Kept flows **simple and reusable**.
